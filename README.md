## Where do most Lehigh University undergraduate students live?
This is an infographic illustrating where undergraduate students at Lehigh live, whether that be on-campus or off-campus. You can find the original data [HERE](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf). This information was gathered in the fall of 2019, and depicts the residence lives of the undergraduate population. With 48.3% of students living in residents halls, this appears to be the most common living space for undergraduates. Off-campus is composed of 38.7% of the undergraduate populatiom, making it the second most common. Lastly, fraternity houses (5.8%) and sorority houses (7.2%) are the least likely residence location of undergraduate students. This data can be used to assess where the most students live, as well as inform further research as to the quality of said residence life and why they breakdown is the way it is.

## What percent of adults reported having symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, by Age?
You can find the original data [HERE](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/). 
This infographic illustrates the percentage of adults who reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression disorder for the COVID-19 pandemic, broken down by age. Adults ages 18-24 showed the highest rate of reporting, with 56.2%, and adults ages 65+ reported the lowest rates of anxiety and depression, at 29.3%. The percentage of adults who reported having symptoms of anxiety depression decreases with age, with 48.9% of adults ages 25-49 and 39.1% of adults ages 50-64. The findings reflect the number of pandemic-related consequences young adults ages 18-24 faced, including the closing of schools and remote work, as explained by KFF. Published in February of 2021, the data set is descriptive of the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s toll on mental health, and specifically highlights how substantially it has impacted young adults. The data was originally gathered between January 6 and 18 of 2021. Although published by KFF, the data was originally sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau: Household Pulse Survey, 2020-2021.
