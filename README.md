## Where do most Lehigh University undergraduate students live?
This is an infographic illustrating where undergraduate students at Lehigh live, whether that be on-campus or off-campus. You can find the original data [HERE](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf). This information was gathered in the fall of 2019, and depicts the residence lives of the undergraduate population. With 48.3% of students living in residents halls, this appears to be the most common living space for undergraduates. Off-campus is composed of 38.7% of the undergraduate populatiom, making it the second most common. Lastly, fraternity houses (5.8%) and sorority houses (7.2%) are the least likely residence location of undergraduate students. This data can be used to assess where the most students live, as well as inform further research as to the quality of said residence life and why they breakdown is the way it is.

## What percent of adults reported having symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, by Age?
You can find the original data [HERE](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/). 
This infographic illustrates the percentage of adults who reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression disorder for the COVID-19 pandemic, broken down by age. Adults ages 18-24 showed the highest rate of reporting, with 56.2%, and adults ages 65+ reported the lowest rates of anxiety and depression, at 29.3%. The percentage of adults who reported having symptoms of anxiety depression decreases with age, with 48.9% of adults ages 25-49 and 39.1% of adults ages 50-64. The findings reflect the number of pandemic-related consequences young adults ages 18-24 faced, including the closing of schools and remote work, as explained by KFF. Published in February of 2021, the data set is descriptive of the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s toll on mental health, and specifically highlights how substantially it has impacted young adults. The data was originally gathered between January 6 and 18 of 2021. Although published by KFF, the data was originally sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau: Household Pulse Survey, 2020-2021.

# Lehigh Undergraduate Population by College

This is a bar chart created using Chartbuilder showing the percentage of Lehigh University's undergraduate population by what college they are enrolled in. Original data can be accessed [here](https://www1.lehigh.edu/about/university-statistics). This data shows that a majority of students are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences, with almost 40% of all undergrad being represented within it. The College of Health and the College of Arts & Engineering both make up just 1% of the undergraduate student body's distribution within colleges. The RCEAS and College of Business both make up around 25%, with Intercollegiate programs dropping below that at 11%.

# South Sudan Population by Year
This is a line chart created using Chartbuilder showing South Sudan's population growth been 2000 and 2020. Original data can be accessed [here](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/south-sudan-population). The chart shows extremely rapid population growth from 2000 until 2014. From 2014 to 2020, the population continues to grow but at a much slower rate than previously. Since 2000, the population of South Sudan close to doubled, starting around 6 million and increasing to 11.5 million. Continued population growth can be expected in coming years at a similar rate to that shown between 2014 and 2000. This data is important in assessing the sustainability of population growth in South Sudan, and can be used to measure future needs of the population when applied to different contexts. I was motivated to explore this data due to the importance of being aware of population growth in other nations, especially due to the negative sustainaibility and economic implications rapid growth may have on individuals.

# Percentage of students in each of Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges over the past five years
![Percentage of students in Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kateturkeltaub/kateturkeltaub.github.io/49556332a951c38907795c8b400365157e4f21cd/Percentage_of_students_in_Lehigh's_three_undergraduate_colleges_College_of_Arts_and_Sciences_Business_Engineering__chartbuilder.svg)
This is a line chart illustrating the differences the percentage of enrollment between the three main undergraduate colleges at Lehigh, which are Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Business. The chart shows a steady decrease in engineering students, while the percent of students enrolled in Arts and Sciences has increased. Business enrollment remains consistent, with a slight decrease in recent years. The decrease in engineering students and the increase in Arts and Sciences enrollment may be related, as they seem to correlate inversely. This data was compiled over the last five years, spanning from 2015 to 2021. The orignial data can be found [here](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile).  

# Self-reported Life Satisfaction vs GDP per capita, 2017
![Self-reported Life Satisfaction vs GDP per capita, 2017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kateturkeltaub/kateturkeltaub.github.io/aa3843d57c670a688d009cbdc81268b12ee265c2/Self-reported_Life_Satisfaction_vs_GDP_per_capita%2C_2017_Life_satisfaction_in_Cantril_Ladder_(World_Happiness_Report_2019)_chartbuilder.svg)
This is a scatter plot showing the relationship between life satisfaction and GDP per capita in a number of countries. The chart explains an overall positive correlation between the two variables. This data is important for assessing the life satisfaction of individuals, as well as allowing viewers to understand the importance that GDP plays in this. The most notable increase in life satisfaction is seen between 1.8 thousand dollars and 40.6 thousand dollars, with it equalizing more so before reaching 100 thousand dollars. The original data can be found [here](ourworldindata.org). This data gives us insight into the life satisfaction of individuals in other countries, and gives us a new perspective on the reality of life in nations with much a lower GDP per capita than we see here in the United States.
